# demonstration text 
A repo for learning how to make websites with Jekull pages 

## Learning Markdown
Plain vanilla text may contain *italics* and **old words**

this paragraph is separated from the previous one by a blank line 
line break -- without a paragraph break 
you can force a line break with two trailing spaces 
And then you will see a small difference. One space. No space. 

Two returns

# Challenge One 

## More info on the lesson 
You can find this lesson [here]https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
You won't find ~~strikethrough~~ here though. 

## Four Reasons you should learn markdown 
1. Less formatting with HTML 
2. Easy to read with formatting 
3. Commonly used for websites and software development 
4. We ~~don't~~ use it in the Carpentries
